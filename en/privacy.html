        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="legal-subtitle">How personal data is handled when visiting this website or sending a direct booking request.</p>

        <div class="legal-card">
          <h2>Data controller</h2>
          <p>Casa Vacanze Fiore Ciampino</p>
          <p>Email: <a href="mailto:casafioreciampino@gmail.com">casafioreciampino@gmail.com</a></p>

          <h2>Data processed</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Contact data</strong> provided by the user (e.g., first name, last name, email, phone, message content), including through the direct booking form (which prepares an email).</li>
            <li><strong>Request details</strong> (e.g., number of guests, check-in/check-out dates, optional notes).</li>
            <li><strong>Technical data</strong> (e.g., IP address and navigation logs) generated by normal website usage and hosting services.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How direct booking works</h2>
          <p>The direct booking form does not process online payments and does not create a booking automatically. It prepares an email message with the details you entered, which is then sent via your email client (or you can write directly to <a href="mailto:casafioreciampino@gmail.com">casafioreciampino@gmail.com</a>).</p>

          <h2>Purposes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Responding to information requests sent by email.</li>
            <li>Handling direct booking enquiries (availability checks, quotes, confirmation and stay organization).</li>
            <li>Ensuring website security and technical operation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Legal basis</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-contractual measures</strong>: managing enquiries before a possible stay contract.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong>: website security and prevention of abuse.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent</strong>: where required (e.g., explicit acceptance of the policy via checkbox).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Recipients</h2>
          <p>Data is processed by the controller and may be processed by technical providers (e.g., website hosting, email provider) acting as service providers.</p>

          <h2>External links and third-party services</h2>
          <p>This website links to external platforms (e.g., Booking, Airbnb, VRBO). Their own privacy policies apply. Embedded third-party content (e.g., YouTube and Google Maps) may also collect data according to their policies.</p>

          <h2>Retention</h2>
          <p>Data shared by email (including booking requests) is kept as long as necessary to manage the request and for organizational/administrative needs, then deleted or anonymized when no longer needed.</p>

          <h2>Your rights</h2>
          <p>You can request access, updates, restriction, or deletion of your data by writing to <a href="mailto:casafioreciampino@gmail.com">casafioreciampino@gmail.com</a>.</p>
